            If you tried to do something but failed (e.g., commands is not admissible), but after trying different plans or commands you succeeded, you should learn from the failures and successes, and the successful methods is a good guidance.

            Avoid including specific items, locations, or overly concrete steps in the rules. 
            Focus on broadly applicable principles that summarize patterns of success or failure.
            NOTE: the history is not always correct, the rules you learned must be successful and beneficial.

            **Guidance:**
                **Analysis Process:**
                - Understand Your Capabilities: Note limitations based on observed failures or non-admissible actions. Record rules that prevent you from repeating errors.
                - Extract Successful Strategies: Identify and save successful subplans or tactics that can be reused in similar situations to enhance efficiency.
                - Avoid Redundant Guidance: Always summarize findings into a maximum of 2â€“3 rules. If the guidance is already covered by previous guidance, do not record it.

                **Output Guidelines:**
                - If no new guidance are found, explicitly state: "NO NEW GUIDANCE at this time."
                - Avoid summarizing or repeating history directly; focus on actionable principles.

                **Examples:**
                History you get: 
                1. You tried to open a drawer but failed. After examining it, you succeeded. 
                2. You tried carrying two objects simultaneously but failed. You succeeded after dividing the tasks, carry one object at a time.
                Guidance you learned from these history:
                1. Always examine an object before attempting to interact with it.
                2. Cannot carry more than one object at a time. Divide tasks accordingly.
